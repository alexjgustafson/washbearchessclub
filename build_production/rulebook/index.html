    <h3 id="us-chess">US Chess Official Rules</h3>
    <p>Tournaments organized by the Washbear Chess Club (WCC) will follow the <em>US Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess, 7th Edition</em> including its 2025 updates.</p>
    <p>Select chapters are available for free as a digital download here: <a href="https://new.uschess.org/news/7th-edition-rule-book-free-chapters-updated-2025">https://new.uschess.org/news/7th-edition-rule-book-free-chapters-updated-2025</a>.</p>
    <p>These free chapters contain most of the rules relevant to players in Washbear Chess Club's over-the-board tournaments.</p>
    <p>Additions, exceptions, clarifications, or revisions to that rulebook will be listed as "club rules" on this page.</p>

    <h3 id="club-rules">Club Rules</h3>

    <h4 id="late-arrival-forfeit">Late-Arrival Forfeiture</h4>
    <p>WCC allows for 30 minutes (or the game's time control, if less than 30 minutes) of waiting before a non-arriving or late-arriving player forfeits the round by default.</p>
    <p>Note is this shorter than the US Chess default of one hour.</p>
    <p>If the late-arriving player informs the tournament director of their intention to arrive, the tournament director may choose to extend the time allowed.</p>

    <h4 id="cell-phones-and-electronic-devices">Cell Phones and Electronic Devices</h4>
    <p>Electronic notation devices approved by US Chess are allowed for their intended use.</p>
    <p>If a player brings any other electronic device to the playing area it must be completely turned off.</p>
    <p>The device must be placed either inside a bag or on the table beside their board visible by their opponent for the entirety of the game. If inside a bag, the bag must remain at the board the entirety of the game (not brought to the bathroom, for example.)</p>
    <p>Consult the tournament director if special accommodations need to be made, for example a medical worker who is "on call."</p>

    <h4 id="reporting-results">Reporting Results</h4>
    <p>Both players are responsible for reporting the result of their game. Either by marking the pairing sheet or informing the tournament director.</p>

    <h4 id="adjournments">Adjournments</h4>
    <p>Players may not request adjournments at WCC events. Directors will only adjourn a game in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
